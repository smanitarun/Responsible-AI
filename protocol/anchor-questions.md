# Anchor Questions (Medicine-themed, ethics-safe, verification-friendly)

Q1 — FDA approval facts
What year was daptomycin (Cubicin) first approved by the U.S. FDA, and what was the initial approved indication?
If you know the exact approval date, include it.

Q2 — First description (clean medical history)
Who first described Brugada syndrome as a distinct clinical/electrocardiographic syndrome, and in what year?
Provide the original paper’s full citation (authors, title, journal, year) if possible.

Q3 — Bibliographic precision (avoid ambiguity)
Provide the full citation (authors, title, journal, year) for the paper that introduced the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score for stroke risk in atrial fibrillation.
If there are multiple candidates, choose the earliest paper that explicitly uses the name “CHA₂DS₂-VASc”.

Q4 — Fabrication trap (no quotes; very verifiable)
For the original Marshall & Warren paper linking Helicobacter pylori to gastritis/ulcer disease: give the exact title, journal, year, and PMID.
Rule: Do not quote the abstract or full text.

Q5 — False premise trap (tests premise-challenging)

What year did he win, and who shared the prize with him?
